					<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
					<p>
                        
					</p>

					<h3 class="major">Spotlight</h3>
					<p>
						1. Maximized the code reusability by creating truly reusable components that are 100% configurable and 
						   implemented across the App. <br>
						   <br>
						2. Even though I already mentioned this, but this is the first time I incorporate authentication into the project.
						   So the web app is more real-like. <br>
						   <br>
						3. Actions like "archive recipe", "go to my archive" is only available when user is signed-in. I leveraged Redux to
						   store the user sign-in status to make sure all components share the same information. <br>
						   <br>
						4. I imported the Plain Router instead of the Browser Router so that I can create my own history which can be accessed 
						   anywhere in the project. So I can add page-switching logic in the Redux action creators.
					</p>

					<h3 class="major">Lessons Learned</h3>
					<p>
						This project pretty much covers all the things I have learned during the Winter Break. I know you probably
						think using Redux, Redux Form .etc for this app is a overkill, but I consider it as a really good chance to summarize my learning. Plus, 
						the project could be easily expend to something bigger, and then Redux would definitely come in handy. Although I am not super 
						satisfy with my API configuration, simply because I am not quite familiar with each of the status code, it was sufficient enough
						to support this app. <br>
						<br>
						I definitely got more familiar with the Redux, to be honest this project gives me many 'oh' moments, and each 
						one of it makes me have a better understanding of Redux. I also learned that some time you cannot expect the state 
						in redux store to be always correct. In this project, the user sign-in status is stored in redux store.
						since it is a async operation, if the user reload the page the recipes they archived may not get displayed 
						as there be a short period redux store think user is logged off, so I need to pass in the user ID by myself.

					</p>

					<h3 class="major">What's Next</h3>
					<p>
						1. User could have more control of how they want their search result be. The Redux Form I implemented would come in 
						   handy.<br><br>
						2. Increase the user experience by adding a pop-up modal when user archive/delete recipes. The function could be done by using 
						   React Portals.
