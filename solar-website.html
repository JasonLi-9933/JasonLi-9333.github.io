					<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
					<p>
                        The reason why I did this project is twofold: 1. The website of our team website at the time was 
                        not very responsiveness-friendly. 2. I just learned Vue2 and looking for a project to get my hands dirty.
                        The project can be divided into roughly 3 stages: Firstly, I set up the routings with Vue Router tool.
                        Secondly, I redesigned the layout of each page and fill in the old content we had. Lastly, I added more inner
						components in the Team page, so it is easier for viewer to navigate through different subteams.
						(Note: since this is a demo project, and also due pandemic everything is online we don't have much new content, so
						I leave only the home page blank.)
					</p>

					<h3 class="major">Spotlight</h3>
					<p>
						1. I hard-coded the responsive navigation bar. <br>
						2. I hard-coded a simple carousel to showcase the car models we have with fade-in-fade-out animation.
					</p>

					<h3 class="major">Lessons Learned</h3>
					<p>
                        This is the first time I construct a multi-page website from scratch. The workflow I was using is really helpful
                        to construct a project systematically, especially dealing with many different kinds of content need to be shown.
                        Another important take-away of this project is that it builds a solid foundation for making other projects in the future.
                        For instance, I am currently learning React and I found that React Router and Vue Router are kind of similar, even through
                        I don't remember tha exact syntax of Vue Router, but I know I did something like this before and I know how it works. 
                        The only thing I need to do it to check out the documentation. And I believe it is a important skill for developers,
                        it is ok to forget how to do it exactly, it is important to be aware of that you did something similar before and know how to 
                        get the information you need from internet or your old code, then make it work. At least this is how I learn and reinforce 
                        my understanding along the way.
